__Apache Beam Data Engineering Assignment__

There are several assignments in this repository that cover various facets of data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Every assignment uses a different set of methods, resources, and tools to analyze and comprehend different datasets.

The following three tasks need to be done

EDA with D3.js    
Auto EDA with Sweetviz  
Apache Beam in Colab   


__Part1-EDA with D3.js in Colab__

Dataset: A complex dataset from Kaggle.
Goal: Utilize D3.js for exploratory data analysis within Colab.

Introduction: Summarize the analysis's goals and the selected dataset.
Data loading and preprocessing: bringing data into line, organizing it, and getting it ready for display.
JavaScript cells are used in Colab to create D3.js visualizations.
Conclusion: Learnings and conclusions drawn from the visual aids.    

__Part2-Auto EDA__

Dataset: A chosen dataset from Kaggle.
Goal: Conduct an automatic EDA using tools like Pandas Profiler or Sweetviz.

Introduction: Justification for the tool and dataset choices.
Importing the dataset into Colab is known as data loading.
EDA with Tool: Using the selected tool to generate an EDA report.
Important conclusions and observations from the auto EDA.    

__Part3-Apache Beam in Colab__

Dataset:A dataset that showcases Apache Beam's features.

Goal: Set up and demonstrate Apache Beam's capabilities within Google Colab.

Overview: Overview of Apache Beam and its importance.
Installation and setup procedures for Apache Beam in Colab.
Importing the dataset into Colab is known as data loading.
Showcasing the Features of Apache Beam: sections that go into great detail about every Apache Beam feature.

summary: An overview of the research and results.    

Final Steps
Every assignment offers the chance to delve deeply into the field of data analysis using a variety of instruments and methods. The foundation for comprehending the different aspects of data exploration and visualization is provided by these assignments.
