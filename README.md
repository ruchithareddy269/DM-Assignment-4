__Apache Beam Data Engineering Assignment__

There are several assignments in this repository that cover various facets of data exploration, analysis, and visualization. Every assignment uses a different set of methods, resources, and tools to analyze and comprehend different datasets.

The following three tasks need to be done

EDA with D3.js    
Auto EDA with Sweetviz  
Apache Beam in Colab   


__Part1-EDA with D3.js in Colab__

Dataset : A complex dataset from Kaggle.
Goal: Utilize D3.js for exploratory data analysis within Colab.

Introduction: Brief about the chosen dataset and the objectives of the analysis.
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and preparing data for visualization.
D3.js Visualizations: Employing JavaScript cells in Colab for D3 visualizations.
Conclusion: Insights and findings from the visualizations.    

__Part2-Auto EDA__

Dataset : A chosen dataset from Kaggle.
Objective: Conduct an automatic EDA using tools like Pandas Profiler or Sweetviz.


Introduction: Rationale behind the dataset and tool selection.
Data Loading: Importing the dataset into Colab.
EDA with Tool: Generating an EDA report with the chosen tool.
Observations: Key insights and findings from the auto EDA.    
__Part3-Apache Beam in Colab__

Dataset : A dataset that showcases Apache Beam's features.

Objective: Set up and demonstrate Apache Beam's capabilities within Google Colab.


Introduction: Introduction to Apache Beam and its relevance.
Setting up Apache Beam in Colab: Installation and setup process.
Data Loading: Importing the dataset into Colab.
